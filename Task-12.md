# 1. Launch a Linux VM and Install Docker services on that VM.

# 2. Launch a Docker container and set up an Apache/ Nginx server over that container.

# 3. Create a simple HTML page to launch over the web server.

# 4. Configure the Docker container such that when we start the VM, the Docker Services are up and running and the container is launched automatically such that the web server is turned to active status to reflect the web page just after Starting VM.

# 5. Perform the same task using Docker File
